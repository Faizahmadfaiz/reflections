What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	A .git hidden directory was created in the directory.We need to do it because after creating repositoriy we can move that directory anywhere we will be able to make git commands.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area acts as a middle between working directory and repository.Before committing a file into repository it is first added to staging area,multiple files can be added to staging area and then at once they are committed to repository.
