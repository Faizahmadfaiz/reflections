How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I was able to compare the two files and hence find the difference there.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Having an access to the entire history , we are able to see the whole developing
    process of the file.So we have an overall better understanding of that.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: More flexibility
    Cons: Manual Work

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    There is no concept of repository in Google Docs I think.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log - shows all previous commits(all versions of files you saved)
    fit diff - shows difference between two files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    At any point of time, we can go back to our working code till the point before something wrong happens

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
